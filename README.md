# Election Analysis using Python
Attempt #2 of Challenge 3

##  Purpose
The purpose of these deliverables is to break down the results of this election data by each county and candidate from the dataset. There is a percentage and count of votes for each county and candidate. The analysis also tells us the total votes and the winning candidate, along with their respective vote percentage and county. The county with the highest voter turnout is featured as well. The data set has over 300,000 votes cast, which is swiftly analyzed through a Python code I designed in Visual Studio Code.
 
## Election- Audit Results

Here is the Deliverable 1 output that breaks down the election results: 

![Deliverable 1](https://github.com/nyhandan/Challenge_3_Python_Election_Analysis_/blob/main/Challenge_3_Resources/Resources/Deliverable%201.png)


- There were 369,711 votes in this dataset. This count is featured at the top of the [command line output](https://github.com/nyhandan/Challenge_3_Python_Election_Analysis_/blob/main/Challenge_3_Resources/Resources/Deliverable%201.png), the total votes is listed.

- There were three counties found in the [dataset](https://github.com/nyhandan/Challenge_3_Python_Election_Analysis_/blob/main/Challenge_3_Resources/election_results.csv): Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe counties. Jefferson county got 10.5% of votes, Denver county had 82.8% of votes, and Arapahoe got 6.7% of the votes. Denver had the highest voter turnout, at 306,055 votes. I specifically mentioned the voter turnout using [this code](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1018/pages/3-dot-6-3-write-the-winning-candidates-results-to-a-text-file?module_item_id=396013) text write method on the output. Jefferson county had 38855 votes, and Arapahoe had 24,801 votes.
